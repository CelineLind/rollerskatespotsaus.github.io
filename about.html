            <p>
                <i>Rollerskate Spots Australia</i> was created out of the need for finding rollerskate (and rollerblade) 
                friendly skate spots! Finding those sweet level-ground, smooth surface spots in our neighbourhoods can 
                be a struggle, especially if you don't know where to look.

            <h2>Acknowledgement of Traditional Owners</h2>
            <p>
                We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we skate and pay respect to Elders past and present. 
                This website was built on Yuggera land.
                <br>
                Throughout this site you will find the locations of skate spots listed with what Indigenous land they are on.
                This information is sourced through the use of a few maps, one being the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/aiatsis-map-indigenous-australia">AIATSIS map of Indigenous Australia</a>. 
                We implore skaters to learn what land they skate upon and seek to understand the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/indigenous-culture/the-importance-of-land/">importance of land to Indigenous Australians</a>.

            <h2>What is verification?</h2>
            <p>
                As much as we would love to be able to skate across Australia and verify that all 
                locations submitted are as great as they seem, we unfortunately cannot. We rely on 
                community verification to determine that skate spots submitted to us are truly located 
                where they are said to be and that they are safe.
