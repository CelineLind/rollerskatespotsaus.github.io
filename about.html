    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Rollerskate Spots Australia was created out of the need for finding rollerskate (and rollerblade) friendly skate spots! Finding those sweet level-ground, smooth surface places in our neighbourhoods can be a struggle, especially if you don't know where to look.
    </p>

    <h2>Acknowledgement of Traditional Owners</h2>
    <p>We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we skate and pay respect to Elders past and present. This website was built on Yuggera land.</p>
    <h2>What is verification?</h2>
    <p>
        As much as we would love to be able to skate across Australia and verify that all 
        locations submitted are as great as they seem, we unfortunately cannot. We rely on 
        community verification to determine that skate spots submitted to us are truly located 
        where they are said to be and that they are safe.
